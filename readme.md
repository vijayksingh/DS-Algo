**Study Approach**
- Practice and Study consistently. No Streak breaks
- Create Flashcards daily.
  - Spend 1-2 hour [synthesizing whatever](https://leetcode.com/discuss/career/449135/How-to-effectively-use-LeetCode-to-prepare-for-interviews) you learn.
- List down all the [aha moments](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/1367198/You-Only-Have-To-Be-Right-Once%3A-Facebook-Offer/1030106) in one file.
- Practice Java / Create Projects in JAVA
- Reserve time for writing notes and practicing flashcards

> NOT TODO LIST
- Block all the social media permanently.
- Don't get distracted by any other technology
  - Don't start learning anything new
    - No for CSS
    - No for any new JS framework
    - No for any tool
    - No for Design
